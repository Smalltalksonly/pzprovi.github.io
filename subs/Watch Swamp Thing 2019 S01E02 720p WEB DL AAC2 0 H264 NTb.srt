Sophomore year...

628
00:41:04,052 --> 00:41:06,790

the time you figured out

and declared a major.

631
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,660
That's about the time I...

632
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:17,285
stumbled out of her
bed and into a bottle.

is your senior year.

636

Because while you were
applying to medical schools

637
00:41:38,573 --> 00:41:41,593
my husband was talking
to divorce lawyers.

638
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:44,494

639

where that kind of strength came from.

642
00:41:56,379 --> 00:41:57,609
And he said

643
00:41:59,043 --> 00:42:00,112
because...

644
00:42:01,825 --> 00:42:05,625
all that darkness wasn't my fault.

645
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:08,783
It was yours.

You said you're good at what you do

647
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:17,627
and that you can help,
that's why you came here.

HARLAN: <i>We could use anything you got.</i>

This drug regimen slowed this
thing, but it hasn't stopped it.

What do you need from me?

00:53:26,768 --> 00:53:28,354
I need access to the hospital's lab

823
00:53:28,379 --> 00:53:30,243
and time to go through
some new findings.

<i>You bet. I'll get on it.</i>

Thank you, Harlan.
